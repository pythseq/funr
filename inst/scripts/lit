## litter does not seem to get .libPaths by default.
## ideas ?
.libPaths("~/Rlibs")
library(funr)

## args as a character string.
## litter does not seem to like this function.
#args = commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE) 
#print(argv)
out = funr(argv, script_name = "litter")


## Use: print(out$value), if you want the exact output
## OR use render_funr(out), to render them in a pretty manner
render_funr(out)


## example with pipes! (need version 0.1.2, from DRAT)
