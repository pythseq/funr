## litter does not seem to get .libPaths by default.
## now seems fixed
## ideas ?
#print(.libPaths())
library(funr)

## args as a character string.
# print(argv)
out = funr(argv, script_name = "litr")


## Use: print(out$value), if you want the exact output
## OR use render_funr(out), to render them in a pretty manner
render_funr(out)


## example with pipes!
